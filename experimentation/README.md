## Jupyter Notebook Guide

The notebook testing\_and\_comparison.ipynb contains all necessary cells to install required packages and execute test and some highlights of the methods

The implementation of the algorithms are in the file `source_code.py`, consider the file `testing_and_comparison.ipynb` imports functions from this file

Key Functions:

	-	eigenvalue_power_method

	-	eigenvalues_QR_algorithm

	-	eigenvalues_characteristic_polynomial_method

Execution Instructions

-	Run all cells sequentially to ensure proper installation and execution.
